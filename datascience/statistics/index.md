### Random variable:
This is kinda unedited and not that well written but you get the point.
A Random variable is not a variable it is a function.

If we think of X as a "random function" instead we can think of the notation for a regular function f(x). And then think of a random variable as X(x). "F as a function of x or X as a function of x".
<<<<<<< HEAD
Let's say the random variable \\(X \sim N(0,1) \\).

This means that the variable X have the density function:
X(x) = P_X(x) = \\( P(X \leq x) \\)  = \\( \int_{-\inf}^{x} \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{\frac{(X-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}dx\\). Which becomes a number.

And when we write \\( P(X \leq x) \\). Which reads "whats the probability that \\(X\leq x\\)".
In this case it is important to understanding that these x:es are pretty much like in the notation \((f(x)\))
This is just a somewhat complicated notation.

Another notation for this is \\( P_{X}(x) = P(X \leq x) \\). This is a better notation.
If we think of the notation \\(f(x)\\). This is the again same thing.

So with this in the back of your head.
