The easiest way to learn is by doing some hard exercises.

[Kaggle.com](https://kaggle.com) has a lot of different examples in both classification and regression.

Here are the variates of data science I've got so far.


### Classification
[Classification](classfication/) is when you try to divide your data in to groups.

### Regression
[Regression](regression/)<br/>

### Tensorflow
[Tensorflow](tensorflow/) is a tool for calculating [neural networks](tensorflow/neuralnet.md) which is both regression and classification depending how you set up the network.

### Statistics
