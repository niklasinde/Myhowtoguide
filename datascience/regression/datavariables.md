In statistics we have two types of variables.

Categorical data:
* Left or Right
* Male or Female
* Which city is a person born?

This can be divided into two groups
* Ordinal Categorical: (Where the ranking matters):
For example Masters level is higher then bachelors level.
* Nominal Categorical:
For example eye color or gender (One is not "better" then the other.)



In total data where it doesn't make sense to add (Left is not double of right), Where someone is born can not be represented by a number.

Continuous data
* Age
* Income


Any data where it makes sense add and subtract and so on (double the age of a person is the double of the age)

A problem is for example when someone if born. If I was born 1993 and someone else is born in 996 they are not double the age of me.

So and a better solution is to convert this to age (current year - year of birth)
