## How do neural networks work?
If we start by looking a the simplest examples of a ANN: inputs with no hidden layer and no activation function (fully connected layer)

We get:

\\[ \begin{equation}
\begin{Bmatrix}
x_{1} \\
x_{2} \\
x_{3}
\end{Bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}
w_{1}& w_{2}& w_{3}
\end{Bmatrix}=
x_{1} w_{1}+x_{2} w_{2}+x_{3} w_{3}
\end{equation} \\]

So here we see that we get the same equation as a multivariable linear regression.









## Activation functions.













Idea "forced neural networks" for faster learning.

Make networks learn faster by setting



How deep should a network be?
Question how many features do you think exists in the data you are trying to predict?









Make a much more shallow network.

Search gradient loss in each additional layer of the network.
