## Let's go!

### Stuff to do.

* Get started with the bachelor thesis

* Look up line search.

* Try the housing dataset with a forward/backward AIC/BIC algorithm. Then run the remaning dataset thru a tensorflow model.

* Finish the [munta latex](https://www.sharelatex.com/project/592edbf359a8a3210557fb14).<br/>





### Questions:
## Math

* What statistical meaning does the different activation
 function have in a neural network?


## Programming

* How can you use Obj-c to get information for a flask/Django app?

## In progress
* Should we use $x, x^{2}$ and so when doing data analysis?

  Yes check out statistical "interaction" in multivariable linear regression.

* What is the optimal way of calculating weights is there another way then gradient decent?

A neural network with a lot of deep layers becomes more of a "approximation" then a "statistical regression". But to increase the possibility of a steeper decline we can take the variables that have the most correlation and is not correlated to any other. Then in we can check that if we add a $x^2$ term to increase the explained variance and decrease the variance of the error. (Check out the anova variance stuff.)


## Done
* How do you connect a (Flask)/Django app to postgres or another SQL-service?
  It's is built into Django. Google models Django.
