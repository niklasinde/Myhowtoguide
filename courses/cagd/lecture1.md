point and vector are not the same because a vector does not have a starting point but if we say that the the vector start at the origin its okey.

A vector space: we need a zero vector and some operation like multiply by scalar and adding.

A point space (affine space):

let V be a linear space ($R^2$ or $R^3$)

and a non-empty set $A$ of "points" and define tha map $p=a+bar{v}$ where $\bar{v} \in V, and p,a \in A$ 

1) for p and a in A there is a unique v in V such rhat p= a+v (addition)

2) a+(v+w)=(a+v)+w assosiative property 



Thought if we are in point a and going to point p there is a unique  vector v that is a + v = p or v = p- a

so subtraction of to points is difined and is a vector.

but then what is addition of two points? it is not defined excrpt for:
